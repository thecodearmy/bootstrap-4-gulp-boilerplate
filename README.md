## Gulp commands
**gulp serve**

The gulp serve command starts a local Browsersync server that serves your files in the browser.
It reloads the current page when changing HTML, PHP, Sass and JS files.
The output of all Sass files go to main.css
All JS files are concatenated into main.js
You can access the development server with other devices on the same network. Go to the "External" address specified by Browsersync (see the terminal) in the web browser of your device.
```
gulp serve
```

**gulp (build)**

The default gulp command is set to creating a "dist" directory with a production version of the project, ready to be deployed.
It minifies and renames JS/CSS assets as well as cleaning the old "dist" directory. CSS is autoprefixed for the latest two browser versions.
```
gulp
```

* Start the MAMP services and run "gulp serve" as before.
